Attending the UTM Digital Open Day, especially the DigitechX 6 Oracle Academy session, was an eye-opening experience that deepened my understanding of how global tech leaders like Oracle contribute to digital transformation in education and industry. I gained valuable insights into cloud technologies, enterprise solutions, and the importance of scalable systems in modern IT infrastructure. The speaker, Mohd Asrul Muhamad Zin, shared practical perspectives that helped bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world applications, especially in areas like database management and system integration. One area of improvement could be enhancing interactivity during the session—perhaps through live Q&A or breakout discussions to engage participants more directly. Additionally, integrating hands-on mini workshops or guided demos would allow students to apply concepts immediately and reinforce learning. Personally, this event inspired me to explore certifications and deeper learning paths in cloud computing and enterprise software. It also reminded me of the importance of staying updated with industry trends and actively participating in tech communities to build both knowledge and professional networks.
